The talks start at 12:30.
At a tech talk someone (usually someone in REG) presents or discusses something, such as about a project or data science/computer science/software engineering topic. They can also be opportunities to look for help and input. We encourage talks at the beginning of projects (before it&amp;rsquo;s certain what exactly you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing) or to discuss a problem you&amp;rsquo;re unsure how to solve.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Talks</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/lightning_talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/lightning_talks/</guid><description>Lightning Talks # Lightning Talks are a meeting series within the tech talk slots in which people give short 10 minute talks. The main goals are to:
Regularly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on. Find overlaps between projects or problems someone else in the team could help with. Generate ideas for future tech talks. Do all this without a big time commitment, both for presenters and attendees. The talks can be on any topic, including but not limited to:</description></item><item><title>Reading Groups</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/reading_groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/reading_groups/</guid><description>Reading Groups # As part of projects or for general interest, members of the team create reading groups to learn about a topic. Reading groups may meet on weekly basis to discuss a chapter from a book, a paper, or to work together on implementing something.
A list of current reading groups and information about them can be found on the Data Science Skills wiki.
Material for the reading groups is stored in the Data Science Skills repository</description></item><item><title>Open Source Hacksessions</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/open_source_hacksessions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/open_source_hacksessions/</guid><description>Open Source Hacksessions # REG runs monthly sessions where we come together and contribute to upstream open-source repositories. The idea is to fence off time dedicated to contributing upstream and to do it together for joy and sociality. We hope to give back to many of the tools we use and learn about new packages by helping them out. Everyone is welcome to come and work on something they want to contribute to or join an effort someone else has already started.</description></item><item><title>Drop-in Sessions</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/drop-in_sessions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/drop-in_sessions/</guid><description>Drop-in Sessions # The group runs regular, informal, community-led sessions for students and researchers. Whether you have general questions on a topic, or are seeking specific technical guidance on, or just want to chat with friendly faces, our drop-in session is the perfect place for you! The sessions offer a friendly, welcoming, non-judgemental environment to receive advice or assistance without concern about being judged on technical knowledge, expertise or understanding.</description></item><item><title>Randomised Coffee Chats</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/coffee_chats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/coffee_chats/</guid><description>Randomised Coffee Chats # Approximately every 2 weeks, we partition REG into groups of 4 or 5 for informal chats. The groups are randomly generated (see the code here) but generally try to ensure that everyone meets different people each week.
If you have not signed up already and would like to join (or conversely if you would like to opt out), please inform the people in charge of the random coffees.</description></item></channel></rss>
