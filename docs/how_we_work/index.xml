If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to learn something new, get help with a problem, share something cool you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, or find out what others in the team are doing, the list below may give an idea of where to look/what to try.</description></item><item><title>Snark Hunts</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/snark_hunts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/snark_hunts/</guid><description>Snark Hunts # A &amp;ldquo;Snark Hunt&amp;rdquo; is a project retrospective based around a facilitated discussion. This is typically carried out during a meeting that lasts for approximately one hour. The output of the meeting is a very short document which can be usefully re-read in the future. The hope is that anyone reading it might be able to find useful learnings to apply to their own work.
You can see notes from all previous Snark Hunts here.</description></item><item><title>Defining Project Doneness</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining-done/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining-done/</guid><description>Defining Project Doneness # This working document was produced as part of Accelerating AI in the Arts and Humanities (AAAH).
As a Research Software Engineer, we often join a collaborative project when a code base already exists. Defining the aims of a collaboration can be challenging, and when there is limited time it is important to apply attention in the right places. The following document is designed to help:</description></item><item><title>Meeting Records</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/meeting_record/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/meeting_record/</guid><description>Meeting Records # When a synchronous meeting is unavoidable, it is critical to produce a clear and thorough record.
The meeting record is important as a reference for what happened at the meeting. In particular, any decisions made or actions assigned need to be clearly recorded for future reference.
A good record will also be invaluable to anyone who was not able to attend an in-person meeting.

The aim is to check that the documentation is clear, installation is easy etc.
Audits should be conducted by people who have not worked on the project.
Past experience # These comments from running the first round of these in June 2021:
Installation is a big barrier for software with complex build requirements. We tried looking at two web app projects (Counterfactual Covid 19 and CROP) and despite Docker images being available we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get them to build correctly.</description></item><item><title>Project Tracking</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/project_tracking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/project_tracking/</guid><description>Project Tracking # This page describes some of the tools we use for tracking projects and other tasks within the team. It does not go into details of how individual projects are managed, but how REG coordinates its commitments to the range of projects its involved in.

It aims to promote the visibility, impact and reuse of research software and to encourage proper citation to ensure researchers and RSEs get credit for their work.
We (REG) have set up a page for The Alan Turing Institute on the RSD. We hope that this page will be a place where we can showcase the variety of software the REG team have developed.</description></item><item><title>Line Management</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/line-management/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/line-management/</guid><description>Line Management # Line management in REG is a little different than in other parts of the Turing as you often will not be working directly with the people you are managing. This guide aims to explain how this relationship might work.
How line management duties are assigned # At (current) senior level, people are expected to line manage 1-2 standards. This will probably change with the new lead role (see the REG role matrix).</description></item><item><title>Publishing Open Access Journal Articles</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/open_access/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/open_access/</guid><description>Open Access Journal Articles # The Turing has access to a block grant to cover open access charges for journal publications for UKRI funded projects if there are not already funds in the project-specific grant to cover them. If you have published an article, you may be able to cover the open access fees using this funding source.

Meetings, calls and screen sharing # Gather # REG uses Gather for some of the coffee breaks and social events. It gives a virtual space (modelled on the office!) to wander around and have conversations with people near to you.
See The REGistry for how to gain entry to gather. Note: Gather is blocked on the Turing VPN and on IT-managed computers.</description></item><item><title>Acronyms and Abbreviations</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/acronyms_and_abbreviations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/acronyms_and_abbreviations/</guid><description>Acronyms and Abbreviations # AIDA: Artificial Intelligence for Data Analytics
