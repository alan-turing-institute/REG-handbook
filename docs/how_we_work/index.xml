If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to learn something new, get help with a problem, share something cool you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, or find out what others in the team are doing, the list below may give an idea of where to look/what to try.</description></item><item><title>Defining Project Doneness</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining-done/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/defining-done/</guid><description>Defining Project Doneness # This working document was produced as part of Accelerating AI in the Arts and Humanities (AAAH).
