To help with this every new employee should be assigned buddies. The buddies are responsible for providing informal friendly faces to offer advice, guidance, and encouragement on any aspect of working within REG and ARC.
We also emphasise that the buddies should be a safe space where new-starters can get help with any technical questions that they feel is silly or trivially easy and may not feel comfortable admitting to the wider group.</description></item><item><title>SocRSE</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/society_of_research_software_engineering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/society_of_research_software_engineering/</guid><description>Society of Research Software Engineering # The Society of Research Software Engineering (SocRSE) is a charitable incorporated organisation with the mission to establish a research environment that recognises the vital role of software in research.
REG supports and encourages its members to join the SocRSE, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth reviewing the society&amp;rsquo;s website and deciding whether to join during your onboarding period.
