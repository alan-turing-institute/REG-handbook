Being involved in reporting issues and discussing ideas are important and valuable aspects to contributing. The handbook uses both issues and discussions on GitHub.
Discussions # The handbook Dicussions are the best place for informal talk about the handbook.
You should feel welcome to create a discussion on any relevant topic, without the formality of an issue.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/getting_started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/getting_started/</guid><description>Getting Started # Install dependencies # To contribute to the handbook you will need

The meeting record is important as a reference for what happened at the meeting. In particular, any decisions made or actions assigned need to be clearly recorded for future reference.
A good record will also be invaluable to anyone who was not able to attend an in person meeting.

This improves the readability of source files and make diffs clearer. The Semantic Line Breaks specification explains the rules and reasoning. The most important rules are,
A semantic line break MUST occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?). A semantic line break SHOULD occur after an independent clause as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (â€”).</description></item><item><title>Adding New Content</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/creating_a_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/creating_a_page/</guid><description>Adding New Content # How Hugo Arranges Content # Pages are build from content files in the content/ directory. Hugo automatically gives pages a URL based on the organisation of files in the content/ directory.
In Hugo, the first directory after content/ is significant and defines the content type. All handbook pages should be nested in the content/docs/ directory.
Sections may be created in content/docs/ (to any depth) by creating a directory containing a content file called _index.</description></item><item><title>Editing a Page</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/editing_a_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/editing_a_page/</guid><description>Editing a Page # If you followed the instructions in the Getting Started section to checkout the repository and serve the handbook locally you can edit a page locally. However, as you may have noticed, at the bottom of each page is a link to edit the page in the GitHub web editor if you would prefer. This may be easy for making small changes.
Pages # Each page is a Markdown file with YAML front matter followed by the page contents in Markdown.</description></item><item><title>Contributing Changes</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/contributing_changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/contributing_changes/</guid><description>Contributing Changes # Once you have made changes, you will need to contribute them back to the remote repository. This page explains the process of pushing your changes back to the remote, and how your contribution will be checked in the CI and review process.
Currently, reviews are not required. Pull requests will be merged when all required CI checks pass. Make sure to mark your pull request as a draft until it is ready to be merged.</description></item><item><title>Reviewing Changes</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/reviewing_changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/reviewing_changes/</guid><description>Reviewing Changes # The review process helps to ensure high quality and catch problems in contributions. When acting as a reviewer, you should see your position as sharing your knowledge and working with the contributors to achieve the best possible result. Reviewing should not be an adversarial process.
Code Quality # As a reviewer, one of your jobs is to ensure the quality of the codebase remains high.
The CI process will help to assess pull requests by subjecting each commit to a series of tests.</description></item><item><title>Advanced</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/advanced/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/advanced/</guid><description>Advanced # Using Data # Through using templates Hugo can build page content from datafiles. This is particularly useful for when you want to display structured data in a page and when it would be easier to maintain a datafile rather than a Markdown or HTML document.
Creating Shortcodes # It is possible to create your own shortcodes. These should be placed in layouts/shortcodes/ .
If you feel the need to use HTML or want to create page content from a datafile (like a YAML file or csv) then a shortcode is probably the right answer.</description></item></channel></rss>
