Being involved in reporting issues and discussing ideas are important and valuable aspects to contributing. The handbook uses both issues and discussions on GitHub.
Discussions # The handbook Discussions are the best place for informal talk about the handbook.
You should feel welcome to create a discussion on any relevant topic, without the formality of an issue.</description></item><item><title>Recognising Contributions</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/recognising_contributions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/recognising_contributions/</guid><description>Recognising Contributions # We aim to recognise all contributions to the handbook, not just those made through commits.

To help with this every new employee should be assigned buddies. The buddies are responsible for providing informal friendly faces to offer advice, guidance, and encouragement on any aspect of working within REG and ARC.
We also emphasise that the buddies should be a safe space where new-starters can get help with any technical questions that they feel is silly or trivially easy and may not feel comfortable admitting to the wider group.</description></item><item><title>Coffee Chats</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/coffee_chats/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/coffee_chats/</guid><description>Coffee Chats # The team has two optional, daily coffee chats at 08:45 and 13:45.

We are super pleased that you&amp;rsquo;re joining our group. This page gives you an overview of what to expect from your first few days. They are maintained by the group, we hope that new-starters feel empowered to edit them if there are useful changes to be made.
Introductions # Each new starter gets assigned two buddies to be friendly points of contact. The person in charge of onboarding should let you know who these are a bit before you start; If that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen, please email them about it.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/getting_started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/getting_started/</guid><description>Getting Started # Install dependencies # To contribute to the handbook you will need

If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to learn something new, get help with a problem, share something cool you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing, or find out what others in the team are doing, the list below may give an idea of where to look/what to try.</description></item><item><title>Lightning Talks</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/lightning_talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/lightning_talks/</guid><description>Lightning Talks # Lightning Talks are a meeting series within the tech talk slots in which people give short 10 minute talks. The main goals are to:
Regularly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on. Find overlaps between projects or problems someone else in the team could help with. Generate ideas for future tech talks. Do all this without a big time commitment, both for presenters and attendees. The talks can be on any topic, including but not limited to:</description></item><item><title>Lunchtime Tech Talks</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/lunchtime_tech_talks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/lunchtime_tech_talks/</guid><description>Lunchtime Tech Talks # The Research Engineering team meets for Lunchtime Tech Talks most Tuesdays over lunch. The talks start at 12:30.
At a tech talk someone (usually someone in REG) presents or discusses something, such as about a project or data science/computer science/software engineering topic. They can also be opportunities to look for help and input. We encourage talks at the beginning of projects (before it&amp;rsquo;s certain what exactly you&amp;rsquo;ll be doing) or to discuss a problem you&amp;rsquo;re unsure how to solve.</description></item><item><title>Open Source Hacksessions</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/open_source_hacksessions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/open_source_hacksessions/</guid><description>Open Source Hacksessions # REG runs monthly sessions where we come together and contribute to upstream open-source repositories. The idea is to fence off time dedicated to contributing upstream and to do it together for joy and sociality. We hope to give back to many of the tools we use and learn about new packages by helping them out. Everyone is welcome to come and work on something they want to contribute to or join an effort someone else has already started.</description></item><item><title>Reading Groups</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/reading_groups/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/regular_events/reading_groups/</guid><description>Reading Groups # As part of projects or for general interest, members of the team create reading groups to learn about a topic. Reading groups may meet on weekly basis to discuss a chapter from a book, a paper, or to work together on implementing something.
A list of current reading groups and information about them can be found on the Data Science Skills wiki.

As a Research Software Engineer, we often join a collaborative project when a code base already exists. Defining the aims of a collaboration can be challenging, and when there is limited time it is important to apply attention in the right places.

The meeting record is important as a reference for what happened at the meeting. In particular, any decisions made or actions assigned need to be clearly recorded for future reference.
A good record will also be invaluable to anyone who was not able to attend an in person meeting.

Audits should be conducted by people who have not worked on the project.
Past experience # These comments from running the first round of these in June 2021:
Installation is a big barrier for software with complex build requirements. We tried looking at two web app projects (Counterfactual Covid 19 and CROP) and despite Docker images being available we weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get them to build correctly.</description></item><item><title>Style Guide</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/style_guide/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/style_guide/</guid><description>Style Guide # Semantic Line Breaks # It is encouraged to use Semantic Line Breaks when writing for the handbook. This improves the readability of source files and make diffs clearer. The Semantic Line Breaks specification explains the rules and reasoning. The most important rules are,
A semantic line break MUST occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?). A semantic line break SHOULD occur after an independent clause as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (—).</description></item><item><title>Adding New Content</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/creating_a_page/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/creating_a_page/</guid><description>Adding New Content # How Hugo Arranges Content # Pages are build from content files in the content/ directory. Hugo automatically gives pages a URL based on the organisation of files in the content/ directory.
In Hugo, the first directory after content/ is significant and defines the content type. All handbook pages should be nested in the content/docs/ directory.
Sections may be created in content/docs/ (to any depth) by creating a directory containing a content file called _index.</description></item><item><title>Project Tracking</title><link>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/project_tracking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/project_tracking/</guid><description>Project Tracking # This page describes some of the tools we use for tracking projects and other tasks within the team.
