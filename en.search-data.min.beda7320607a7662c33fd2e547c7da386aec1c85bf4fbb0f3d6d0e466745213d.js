It is possible to use all of these in combination. For Turing members only, the ARC group have a repo with suggested configuration files which you can copy/adapt as required.\nType checkers # Type checking is optional in Python but is generally recommended. There are several tools which can perform type checking:\nmypy - This type-checker has the distinction of including Guido van Rossum in its core development team. pyright - By Microsoft. pytype - By Google. Currently, no opinion is offered in selecting between these tools.\nJupyter Notebooks # Python-based Jupyter Notebooks are widely used within REG. There are some specific considerations when applying coding standards to notebooks.\nDetails to be added.\nAutomation (pre-commit \u0026amp; actions) # A convenient way to incorporate many of these tools and checks into your workflow is to use pre-commit. Below is an example. You could adapt this to your needs, or create your own from the many hooks described in the documentation.\n# See https://pre-commit.com for more information # See https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html for more hooks repos: - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks rev: v4.2.0 hooks: - id: trailing-whitespace - id: end-of-file-fixer - id: check-yaml - id: check-xml - id: check-json - id: pretty-format-json args: [--no-ensure-ascii, --no-sort-keys, --autofix] files: \u0026#34;.+json\u0026#34; - id: check-added-large-files - repo: https://github.com/psf/black rev: 22.3.0 hooks: - id: black # files: \u0026#34;*.py\u0026#34; exclude: \u0026#34;.+/ignore_this_legacy_file.py\u0026#34; - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-autopep8 rev: \u0026#39;v1.6.0\u0026#39; # Use the sha / tag you want to point at hooks: - id: autopep8 - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy rev: \u0026#39;v0.960\u0026#39; # Use the sha / tag you want to point at hooks: - id: mypy exclude: \u0026#34;.+/ignore_this_legacy_file.py\u0026#34; - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort rev: v5.10.1 hooks: - id: isort This example checks:\nThere is no trailing whitespace at the end of each line.

In due course we should generalise this to cover other languages.\nGeneral # Some common particular formatting/encoding options can be configured for a range of editors/IDEs, by using EditorConfig in your repo. A .editorconfig needs to be placed in the root of your repo.\nMany (but not all) editors support EditorConfig files, allowing different members of your project team to use their own favourite editor, whilst maintaining common coding standards. Some support EditorConfig natively, others require a plugin to support EditorConfig.\nThere is some overlap in functionality between EditorConfig and Flake8. Crudely EditorConfig applies standards to files as they are created/edited, whilst Flake8 checks all files (irrespective of origin) on demand.\nBoth tools need to be set up en ensure that they are mutually compatible. However, since the configurations for both Flake8 and EditorConfig rarely change after the initial setup of the project, this is not a problem in practice.\nVS code # VS Code Python documentation ARC suggested config (Turing members only) Extensions # Focusing on Python only, useful extensions include:\nPython - adds core functionality for linting/navigating/debugging/etc. Pylance Jupyter Python Indent - improves editor behaviour for matching indentation across lines autoDocstring - auto-generate template docstrings IntelliCode - improved auto-completion/code suggestions Black formatter (pre-release) - auto-format code with black isort (pre-release) - auto-format code with isort Python Type Hint - helps with completing type-hints NB: The black and isort pre-release packages are currently designed to work with the Python pre-release version. This is likely to be consolidated/improved in the future.\nSettings # VS Code Settings are stored in:\nGlobal user settings: ~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/settings.json Project-specific (Workspace) settings: \u0026lt;PROJECT_ROOT\u0026gt;/.vscode/settings.json You can also customise most settings via the Code -\u0026gt; Preferences -\u0026gt; Settings menu. For Python specifically note the Extensions -\u0026gt; Python section.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example config for Python (reliant on installing the extensions above):\n{ \u0026#34;python.linting.flake8Enabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;python.linting.mypyEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;python.testing.pytestEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;python.linting.pylintEnabled\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;autoDocstring.docstringFormat\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;numpy\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;[python]\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;editor.rulers\u0026#34;: [88], \u0026#34;editor.defaultFormatter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;ms-python.black-formatter\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;editor.formatOnSave\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;editor.codeActionsOnSave\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;source.organizeImports\u0026#34;: true }, }, } It does the following:\nActivates linting with flake8, mypy and pylint I\u0026rsquo;d suggest using flake8 at a minimum, but you may not want all three activated as it gets quite noisy and there\u0026rsquo;s some overlap between them. Sets pytest to be the default test framework. Sets numpy to be the default format for docstrings generated with autoDocstring. Sets black to be the default formatter, and automatically runs black and isort when saving a file. Adds a vertical ruler to the editor at 88 characters (default line length used by black) for Python files only. Note that:\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible to specify arguments for the linters/formatters in settings.json, but I\u0026rsquo;d suggest using each tool\u0026rsquo;s own configuration files (e.g. .flake8), as these will then be picked up by other tools and editors as well. (e.g. Should configure flake8 and isort to be compatible with black). If enabled tools are not installed in your Python environment VS Code should prompt you to install them. You are likely to have some non-Python specific configuration as well, so add the settings above to your settings.json file rather than overwriting it completely. Selecting Python interpreter # VSC Python Interpreters Docs\nFor each workspace VS Code can be configured to use a specific Python interpreter (environment). That interpreter is then used by default when doing anything with your code (running scripts, linting, tests etc.)\nTo set the interpreter:\nOpen a .py file Click on the details of the currently used environment on the status bar (bottom right) Select an interpreter from the list that appears (or write the path to it) Or from the command palette:\nCmd-Shift-P -\u0026gt; Search for \u0026ldquo;Python: Select Interpreter\u0026rdquo; Linting # VSC Liniting Docs\nIf linters are activated (see Settings) they will be run after saving a file, and any problems the enabled tools encounter will be highlighted in-line in the editor, and be listed in the \u0026ldquo;Problems\u0026rdquo; tab of the panel at the bottom (or select View -\u0026gt; Problems from the menu).\nHovering over a piece of code with a problem in the editor will give you more details about it, and may have a \u0026ldquo;Quick Fix\u0026rdquo; available, which will edit the code for you to fix it.\nFormatting # VSC Formatting Docs\nVS code can use a few different file formatters (e.g. black, yapf, autopep8 - we recommend black), which can be configured to run automatically when saving files (see settings above) or with the following shortcuts:\nOption-Shift-F Save the file (if auto-formatting is configured) Right-click in a Python editor -\u0026gt; Format Document Cmd-Shift-P (Opens Command Palette) -\u0026gt; Search for \u0026ldquo;format\u0026rdquo; -\u0026gt; \u0026ldquo;Format Document\u0026rdquo; Running tests # VSC Testing Docs\nIf you have enabled pytest (or another framework, e.g. unittest), tests will be discovered and appear in the Testing menu (lab bottle on the left side menu).\nFrom here you can run all/individual tests. You can also search for \u0026ldquo;Tests\u0026rdquo; in the command palette (Cmd-Shift-P) to find options for running tests. If a test fails, clicking on it will show the error message. You can also debug tests (see debugging).\nIf you have a tests file open in an editor the latest pass/fail status of a test will be shown (or a play button if the test hasn\u0026rsquo;t run before) - running tests can be triggered from there too.\nDebugging # VSC Debugging Docs\nDetails to be added.\nOther tips and tricks # Auto-import: If you start typing a function name that hasn\u0026rsquo;t been imported, VS Code will pop up a list of suggested functions and \u0026ldquo;Auto-Import\u0026rdquo; them (add an import statement to the top of the script) if you select one of them. Rename symbol: Right-clicking on a (variable/function/class/etc.) name in a file, selecting \u0026ldquo;Rename symbol\u0026rdquo;, and entering a new name will change the name of all instances of that across your codebase (but respecting the scope of the renamed entity). Jupyter: The Python extension comes with a Jupyter extension so you can run and edit notebooks in VS Code. Personally, I prefer the native Jupyter notebook/lab interface to the VS Code one. AutoDocstring: If the AutoDocstring extension is installed, typing \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; then hitting enter will generate a template docstring for you containing placeholders for all arguments (including their types if type hints are used in the function definition). Go to definition: Right-clicking on a (variable/function/class/etc.) name and selecting \u0026ldquo;Go to definition\u0026rdquo; will take you to where that thing is defined in the codebase. Git: The editor highlights modifications to the code (by the line numbers), and you can also commit etc. from VS Code using the Source Control menu on the left. Docker: There are extensions (1, 2) for running code in containers/attaching a VS code window to a container.

If your branch was called my_branch you would run\ngit switch my_branch git rebase origin/main If you want to tidy up your commits or messages you might want to use git rebase -i.\nGit will notify you of any conflicts. If there are conflicts you will need to fix them iteratively, running git rebase --continue to apply each commit.\nWhen the rebase is done, you will need to force push your changes as you have rewritten the history of your branch.\ngit push -f Rewriting history is considered impolite on a branch where you are working collaboratively. It can cause problems when the state of a remote changes unexpectedly. The Review Process # Once your pull request has been submitted the handbook maintainers will be prompted to make a review. Each pull request requires at least one approval from the maintainers before merging. If a reviewer requests any changes or makes any comments, these must be resolved before the pull request can be merged.\n"}),e.add({id:15,href:'/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/reviewing_changes/',title:"Reviewing Changes",section:"Contributing",content:" Reviewing Changes # The review process helps to ensure high quality and catch problems in contributions. When acting as a reviewer, you should see your position as sharing your knowledge and working with the contributors to achieve the best possible result. Reviewing should not be an adversarial process.\nCode Quality # As a reviewer, one of your jobs is to ensure the quality of the codebase remains high.\nThe CI process will help to assess pull requests by subjecting each commit to a series of tests. Some tests are required to pass and will block merging until they do.\nOther tests are allowed to fail. This is because these tests check external hyperlinks which can fail for reasons out of our control. For example, a website being offline or a rate limiting API. However, you should always aim to have all tests passing and investigate why any test fails. In particular, a genuinely incorrect link should not be ignored.\nYou should always clone the branch, build the handbook locally (using hugo server --minify) and inspect the changes using your browser. Not all bugs will be caught by CI and not all changes will be obvious in the source files.\nReviewing the Pull Request # Use the GitHub review system to check the diffs of all source files.\nYou should make use of line comments where you have comments or questions about particular lines of sections. This gives context so that everyone knows where the problem is or what the question refers to.\nLine comments can also be used to suggest changes (using the Â± button). You should do this when you have a simple solution. This is an excellent way to share knowledge.\nWhen you are finished, submit your review making sure to choose \u0026ldquo;comment\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;approve\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;request changes\u0026rdquo; as appropriate.\nChanges # If you request changes, the pull request will enter an iterative process where the contributors make adjustments you repeat the review process.\nThe contributors may accept your proposed changes, make their own changes or push back against changes. All of these may be appropriate. It is important to work together with the contributors to resolve any conversations. All conversations must be resolved before merging.\nMerging # Update your review status to \u0026ldquo;approve\u0026rdquo; when you are happy with the state of the pull request. When all reviewers are satisfied, merge the pull request.\n"}),e.add({id:16,href:'/REG-handbook/docs/contributing/advanced/',title:"Advanced",section:"Contributing",content:" Advanced # Using Data # Through using templates Hugo can build page content from datafiles. This is particularly useful for when you want to display structured data in a page and when it would be easier to maintain a datafile rather than a Markdown or HTML document.\nCreating Shortcodes # It is possible to create your own shortcodes. These should be placed in layouts/shortcodes/ .\nIf you feel the need to use HTML or want to create page content from a datafile (like a YAML file or csv) then a shortcode is probably the right answer.\nYou should refer to Hugo\u0026rsquo;s templates and functions documentation for resources to help writing a shortcode.\nPartial Templates # Whole page templates are built from of a number of smaller partial templates. This approach reduces repeated code in templates and help keep making changes simple.\nThe theme defines a number of dummy partial templates for us to overwrite.\nFor example, the Creative Commons notice at the bottom of each page was added by editing layouts/partial/docs/inject/footer.html .\n"})})()
