# Project Tracking

This page describes some of the tools we use for tracking projects and other tasks within the team.

## Hut23 GitHub Repo

The [Hut23 repo](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23) is the central hub for most team matters and admin.

- [Project Tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2): Board shows all upcoming, current and completed projects. There's an issue for each project (see below).
- [Issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/issues): Each project has an issue following a common template, including a general description of a project and its current status, for example. There are also issues for service areas and other activities/organisational issues for the team.

### Project Repos

All repos in the Turing organisation that REG have worked on should have the `hut23` tag.
So if you're looking for something from a previous project [searching for these tags](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ahut23+org%3Aalan-turing-institute&type=Repositories) may be a good place to start.
Additionally, they should have a tag of the format `hut23-123`, where `123` is the issue number for that project in the Hut23 repo.

### Forecast & Wimbledon

We use [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/974183/schedule/projects) to track everyone's allocations to projects.
You can see which projects & service areas everyone in the team is currently involved in, as well as what they were allocated to in the past and will be allocated to in the future.

"[Wimbledon planner](https://wimbledon-planner.azurewebsites.net/)" is an online version of a poster we previously had in the office to display the information in Forecast.
It's easier to see allocations for a longer period, and you can click project names to take you directly to the issue describing that project in the Hut23 repo.
