# Checklist

This page attempts to list all the things that a new starter should remember to do.
It makes no guarantees of completeness, and attempts to list both compulsory things and optional ones.
It has been written by new starters as they go.
If you've recently started in REG and find yourself doing anything related to getting started, that others might want to do as well but that is not on this list, please add it.
If anything is unclear, please figure it out by e.g. asking your buddies, and then clarify it here.
