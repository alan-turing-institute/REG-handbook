# First Few Days

**Welcome!**

We are super pleased that you're joining our group.
This page gives you an overview of what to expect from your first few days.
They are maintained by the group, we hope that new-starters feel empowered to edit them if there are useful changes to be made.

## Introductions

Each new starter gets assigned two buddies to be friendly points of contact.
The
[the person in charge of onboarding](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#responsibilities)
should let you know who these are a bit before you start;
If that doesn't happen, please email them about it.
Your buddies will welcome you on the first day.

In the first few days there will also be welcome coffee to give you a chance to introduce yourself to the whole REG team, and within the first few weeks you will also have a 1-on-1 meeting with REG's Director.

You will have a week or so before you will be assigned to a project.
Please use this time to do admin stuff, set up your laptop and the tools REG uses, get to know people, and shadow meetings (see below).
We go over the main points below, but for an attempt at listing all the small tasks that occupy a new starter, please see (and improve!) [this checklist](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/New-starter-checklist).

## Administrivia

HR will set up a meeting with you to discuss general information *e.g.* pay, health, leaves, benefits.
IT will also meet you to discuss accounts and Turing wide systems.
Both of these will typically take place in the first day or two.

We have a
[dedicated page]({{< relref "/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/systems_set_up.md" >}})
for various systems REG uses.
**Have a look at the high priority section on your first day**.

We also have a
[Remote Working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Remote-Working)
page for Zoom, Teams, and Gather.

REG offers new starters the opportunity to shadow meetings across the group to meet people and get a feel for how we work.
The
[shadowing document](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#documents)
should be updated for the weeks you start, if hasn't been please bug
[the person in charge of onboarding](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#responsibilities)
.

To access the office you will need a British Library pass.
This may take a while to get, please ask
[HR](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#points-of-contact)
about it.
In the meanwhile, you can either enter the British Library through the general public entrance and come talk to the Turing's reception, or preferably arrange for a visitor pass for yourself for the days when you're coming in.
For the first day or two, ask your line manager to arrange this, once you've got your Turing account going you can directly ask reception.

The password for the "ATI Guest" Wi-Fi network can be seen hanging around the office.
[IT](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#points-of-contact)
can arrange access to the [Eduroam](https://eduroam.org/) network.
Eduroam credentials can be used to access Wi-Fi at many academic institutions.

Please also write a short, informal paragraph about your background for to be put into the next REG newsletter,
and send it to
[the newsletter owner](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#responsibilities).

## Overview of Office, Team, Projects

You may want to browse REG's portfolio of projects in the
[project tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2)
to get an idea of what we're up to.

If you like, you can see the
[team reporting structure](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Team-reporting-structure).
Note, however, that we do not have a hierarchical culture, and line managing is an administrative rather than an operational role.

## Organization of Work

With your line manager or a team member discuss:

- Role of head of team
- Groups and projects
- Managing your time and growth
- How we work (practices, tools, languages, *etc.*)

## Your Development Goals

With your line manager discuss how you would like to grow and develop into your role.
Ask your line manager about opportunities to support your development.
Think about your goals independently before next meeting.

## Culture

With your line manger discuss the team culture.

## Set up Your Machine and Coding Environment

See [systems setup]({{< relref "/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/systems_set_up.md" >}}).

## Regular Events

Check out our [regular events and coffee breaks]({{< relref "/docs/regular_events/_index.md" >}}).
Please consider signing up for a
[tech talk]({{< relref "/docs/regular_events/lunchtime_tech_talks.md" >}})
sometime in your first six weeks.
