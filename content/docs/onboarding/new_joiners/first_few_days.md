# First Few Days

**Welcome!**

We are super pleased that you're joining our group.
This page gives you an overview of what to expect from your first few days.
They are maintained by the group, we hope that new-starters feel empowered to edit them if there are useful changes to be made.

## Introductions

Each new starter gets assigned two buddies to be friendly points of contact.
Your line manager should let you know who these are.
If you haven't been assigned a buddy please email [the person in charge of
onboarding](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#responsibilities).
They will welcome you on the first day.

Before you start there will be a welcome coffee to give you a chance to introduce yourself to the team.

Please also write a short, informal paragraph about your background for to be put into the next newsletter.

IT will also meet you to discuss accounts and Turing wide systems.

We also have a [Remote Working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Remote-Working) page for Zoom, Teams, and Gather.

You will have a week or so where you are not assigned to a project.
Please take advantage of this to shadow meetings across the group to meet people and get a feel for how we work.
The [shadowing

Before working from the office, you should check with [HR](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#points-of-contact) that they have your pass ready.
The password for the "ATI Guest" Wi-Fi network can be seen hanging around the
office.
[IT](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#points-of-contact) can arrange access to the [Eduroam](https://eduroam.org/) network.
