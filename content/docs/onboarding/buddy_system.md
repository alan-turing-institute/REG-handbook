# Buddy System

It can be daunting starting a new job, especially remotely where there is sometimes less opportunity for casual questions.
To help with this every new employee should be assigned buddies.
The buddies are responsible for providing informal friendly faces to offer advice, guidance, and encouragement on any aspect of working within REG and ARC.

We also emphasise that the buddies should be a safe space where new-starters can get help with any technical questions that they feel is silly or trivially easy and may not feel comfortable admitting to the wider group.

## The Process

Before the new starter starts at the Turing they should be assigned **two buddies** from our [buddy pool](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Buddy-Sign-up-and-Matches).
If possible, the buddies should not be assigned to the projects on which the new starter is likely to work, and ideally at a similarly seniority to the new starter.

We would also like for each new starter to have a third buddy from some other team.
We think that in a remote & hybrid setting it will help new-starters meet people and get a feel for the wider Turing ecosystem.
This has been trialed in a few instances, to positive feedback, but to make this be standard practice we would need it to be more bidirectional, with REGers volunteering to buddy with people outside of REG.

The new-starter should be made aware of the buddies' role before they start, and meeting their buddies should typically be the first appointment on their first day.

## Buddy Guidelines

- Have a coffee with the new employee on their first day.
- If needed, introduce them to the team at welcome coffee.
- Be as informal as possible, make the new starter feel welcome and comfortable.
- Make sure the new starter is familiar with the [New Starter page]({{< relref "/docs/onboarding/new_joiners" >}}). Check for sticking points.
- Meet the new starter where they are at.
- Make it clear that the new employee can get in touch any time for questions and concerns, regardless of triviality.
- Emphasise that you're also there for technical pointers. This is to encourage the new-starter to be comfortable asking for help when they are stuck and hopefully lessening imposter syndrome anxiety.
- Have a check-in chat with the new starter at least once in the first couple of weeks, and again a few weeks after. During these check-ins, uncover pain points and concerns.
- Help socialise the new employee to the group's culture and processes.
- Be open, honest, and respect confidentiality.
- If needed, help make introductions.

## Tips for Buddies

- Don’t worry about being perceived as the expert. Focus your attention on the new employee.
- Be patient: It takes time to develop a relationship. Don’t try to cover everything right away.
- Be positive: New employees will grow into their roles if given proper reinforcement.
- Don’t try to force a relationship. New employees will vary in how much they turn to a buddy.
- Try to identify the new employee’s personality and communication style and adapt accordingly.
- Don’t be judgemental. Simply offer feedback.
- Maintain a good attitude and a teaching spirit.

## How to be a Buddy

Being a buddy can be a rewarding process.
You will help avoid new starters feeling at sea and reaffirm their decision to join the group.
