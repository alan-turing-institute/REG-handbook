# Changelogs

For any non-trivial code, it is worth maintaining a Changelog.

This is valuable as it is a record of changes _from the perspective of users_ (rather than git commit messages which are often only meaningful to the developers involved).

A recommended format for Changelog files is given at [Keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

All notable changes to a project should be documented in this file.

## Semantic Versioning

A related concept is [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

In most cases, semantic versioning is recommended. You should state explicitly whether or not you are using semantic versioning in both your project's README and CHANGELOG files.
