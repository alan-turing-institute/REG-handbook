# Azure

Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform, through which Turing members have access to a wide range of computing and data storage resources.

## Setting up Azure

You can access Azure through the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), using your Office 365 credentials.

To experiment with Azure you should request a trial account with Â£300 credit using this [TopDesk Link](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=ac51b39d8bfc46f9bf41132ef8601b5e&from=7edfe644-ac0d-4895-af98-acd425ee0b19&openedFromService=true). When using Azure for projects you can use the same form to request a project-specific subscription with its own budget.
