# Books and Journal Access

## Get books from the library

You need to get a membership card, then books can be requested. Note that the library does not do loans.

If you register as a researcher / academic then you get a longer lasting reader pass. You need proof of identity with signature and proof of address to get a reader pass. See [here](https://www.bl.uk/help/how-to-get-a-reader-pass).
