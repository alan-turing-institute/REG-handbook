# Wellbeing

The Turing provides a number of support mechanisms to protect employees' wellbeing.

The most up-to-date information can be found [on Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2228). A summary follows here:

## Report + Support

[Report + Support](https://reportandsupport.turing.ac.uk/) is an online platform where you can report cases of bullying, harassment, discrimination, assault, hate crime, sexual misconduct, or a breach of the Turing's values (Trust, Inclusivity, Respect, Leadership, Transparency, Integrity).
Reports can be made anonymously if you so choose.

## Care first

All employees at the Turing can access the [Care first employee assistance programme](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2272).
This includes a 24-hour phone counselling service, online counselling, and advice services.
Contact details and links are available on the Mathison page.

The employee assistance programme also provides access to the ['My Possible Self' app](https://www.mypossibleself.com/) for monitoring and improving mental health.

## Private medical / dental insurance

The Turing provides a [private medical insurance plan from Bupa](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/3017).
You have to opt in: if you want to sign up, contact HR with the information requested on the above Mathison page.
You can choose to have either the medical insurance with or without the dental plan.

The cost of the medical insurance itself is covered by the Turing, but you have to pay for the first Â£100 of treatment (this is called the 'excess'), and because this is a [taxable benefit](https://www.gov.uk/tax-company-benefits) you also have to pay tax on the cost of the medical insurance.
The dental plan add-on has an annual flat rate charge.

It is worth noting that the medical insurance includes cover for pre-existing conditions, as well as mental health, which means that you can use it to access therapy with counsellors or psychologists.
You can use the [Bupa finder](https://www.finder.bupa.co.uk/) to search for recognised medical professionals.

## Mental health first aiders

There are a number of mental health first aiders in the Turing whom you can speak to and who can help you obtain support.
A full list can be obtained [on Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2119).
(Unfortunately, this does not yet include anyone in REG.)

## External supervision

All Turing staff have access to [individual, once-per-month sessions with an external supervisor, Debbie Dixon](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/3052).
External supervision is meant to provide participants with techniques and methods to navigate difficult situations, particularly at work.
However, it is not a form of therapy and should not be seen as a replacement for that.

## Free Headspace membership

Headspace is an app for mindfulness and meditation.
The Turing is a Headspace partner, meaning that all employees can access [free membership to Headspace](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2249).
You can also add 5 other people to your membership for free.
Instructions on how to access the Turing subscription can be found on the Mathison link above.
