# Booking a Meeting Room

There are instructions on how to book a room on [Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Content/Document.aspx?id=2118&SearchId=175781&utm_source=interact&utm_medium=quick_search&utm_term=meeting+rooms).

The simplest way of finding a room is to use the `Scheduling Assistant` on a meeting invite.

Then scroll down to `Add Location`. This will give you a list of Available Rooms for your specific time. It will update when you move the time window.
