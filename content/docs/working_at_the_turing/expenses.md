# Expenses

Out-of-pocket expenses should be reclaimed using Certify. You should submit an expense claim on Certify for expenses incurred within a given month as soon as possible, and no later than 60 days after the expense is incurred (except for visa costs, which can be claimed up to a year after starting employment)

In the first instance, look at the information provided by the Finance team about how to use Certify on Mathison:

(This also includes links to Certify's own user guides and videos)
