# Expenses

## Out-of-pocket expenses

Out-of-pocket expenses should be reclaimed using ERP. You should submit an expense claim for expenses incurred within a given month as soon as possible, and no later than 60 days after the expense is incurred (except for visa costs, which can be claimed up to a year after starting employment).

In the first instance, look at the information provided by the Finance team about how to use ERP on Mathison:

## Booking Travel and Accommodation

Gray Dawes is the Institute's pre-paid travel and accommodation booking system, allowing staff to book without incurring personal costs.

:warning: Important: Staff are not automatically added to Gray Dawes.
If you need to make a booking, please email the [Finance Team](mailto:expense@turing.ac.uk) to request an account.
It can take 5-7 working days for your account to set up, so make sure you do this in advance.

Detailed instructions for making a booking can be found on [Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2738).
The most straight forward way to do this is as follows:

1. Complete the [Gray Dawes Approval Form on Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Utilities/Uploads/Handler/Uploader.ashx?area=composer&filename=Gray+Dawes+approval+form.xlsx&fileguid=49b359b3-59c3-439e-8a16-810ba5f0ae26) and save the file.
1. Use [Docusign](https://apps.docusign.com/send/home) to request approvals:
    1. Click the "Start" dropdown and select "Send an Envelope".
    1. Upload the Excel document from step 1.
    1. Untick the box that says "Travel form template".
    1. Add 4 recipients: yourself, your principal (see the [Team reporting structure](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Team-reporting-structure) if unsure), your director, and [Expenses](mailto:expense@turing.ac.uk).
    1. Request signatures from yourself (applicant) and your principal and director (approvers).
    Add a new row for a second approver if required.
    1. Sign, submit, and send the document.
1. Once approved, proceed to book on [Gray Dawes](https://www.gdg.travel/login/).
