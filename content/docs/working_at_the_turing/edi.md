# Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion

## Overview

The Turing has a strong commitment towards EDI, which is formally set out in the Institute's EDI [Strategy](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-03/edi-strategy-report_v1.2_updated_16.03.2023_0.pdf) and [Action Plan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/edi-action-plan_final.pdf).
For current Turing staff, you can also access an [EDI section on Mathison](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/Interact/Pages/Section/Default.aspx?section=3684).

## How to get involved

If you are keen to be involved in the EDI work around REG and the Turing, do feel free to join the `#edi-equality-diversity-inclusion` channel on Slack, and/or contact:

- in the first instance, [the people involved in the REG EDI service area.](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry)

   Besides the people directly allocated to this service area, we also have a group of volunteers who are involved on a 'best-effort' basis.
   You are welcome to join in any capacity!
- [the Turing's dedicated EDI team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/equality-diversity-and-inclusion)

Below we've described a handful of specific initiatives at the Turing which REG have been involved with.
This list is not exhaustive (nor should it be: there is always more to be done!).

### HDR UK Black Internship

Since 2022 REG has been involved in hosting interns from the [Black Internship programme by Health Data Research UK](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/study-and-train/train/health-data-science-black-internship-programme/).
Interns have typically been involved with one health-related project from REG, plus many other activities around the Turing.
You can see [a researcher spotlight on Olajumoke](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/spotlights/olajumoke-olatunji), one of our interns from 2023.

### EDI Annual Report

Each year the Turing publishes an annual report (see [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-02/edi_annual_report_october_2021-2022_public_version_002_1.pdf) for the most recent one, covering the period between October 2021 and September 2022), as well as a gender pay gap (see [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-03/2023.03.30_gender_pay_gap_report.pdf)).
REG typically assists the EDI team with analysis of the underlying data and recommendations on how to treat sensitive data.

### Network Groups

The Turing has set up four EDI network groups centred on specific topics, with the aim of providing feedback to the Institute's EDI team and senior management:

- [Disability and Wellbeing](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2088)
- [Gender Equality](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2089)
- [LGBTQ+ Equality](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2090)
- [Race Equality](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2091)

REG members are strongly encouraged to participate in these groups.
Additionally, group chairpersons (who can be from REG) are awarded an honorarium.

### BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium

Since 2023, the Turing has been a sponsor for the [BCSWomen Lovelace Colloquium](https://bcswomenlovelace.bcs.org/), a one-day conference for women and non-binary students in computing fields.
In 2023 REG sat on the careers panel and also (together with other teams from the Turing) had a stall at the conference.
