# Printing Event Name Tags

For certain events (most notably Away Day, but also e.g. conferences), you may find that you need to print name tags for attendees.

## Step 1: Prepare the printouts

TODO

## Step 2: Print the tags

This is the most complicated bit, because it involves printers.

You will need to obtain A4 perforated paper which can be fed into the bypass tray of a printer.
The paper looks like this:

{{< figure

  alt="Perforated paper"
  width="350"

This paper can be found in a cupboard near the 1st floor printer (if in doubt, ask any members of the Facilities team).

You can use any of the printers in the Turing for this, as long as they are working.

First, load the perforated paper into the bypass tray, **face down**, and with the long edge of the paper facing into the printer.
(It doesn't matter which way round the paper is rotated, because it is symmetrical.)

When you do this, there will be a dialogue box that pops up on the printer screen.
On this screen, select 'A4' as the paper size and 'Cardstock' as the paper type.

Then, open the name tags document.
In the printing dialog box, select the printer you're using,
**Make sure to disable double-sided printing**,
then scroll down to the 'Paper Feed' and 'Printer Features' sections.

Under **'Paper Feed'**, select **'Tray 5 (Bypass)'**.

{{< figure

  alt="Paper feed section of print dialog box"

And under **'Printer Features'**, specify **'Cardstock'** as the paper type.

{{< figure

Then, click print, and the name tags should print out.

## Step 3: Obtain the name tag holders

Empty name tag holders can be obtained from the Turing's Events team.
Simply drop them an email (`events at turing.ac.uk`) telling them how many you need and when you need them by.

They look like this:

{{< figure
  src="name_tag_images/holders.png"
  alt="Empty name tag holders"

## Step 4: Assemble the name tags

Just press the name tags out from the perforated paper and insert them into the name tag holders.
