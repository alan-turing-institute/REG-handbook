# Reasonable Adjustments, Access to Work, and Office Accessibility

## Reasonable Adjustments

Reasonable adjustments are changes to workplace procedures, practices, or environments that help ensure individuals with disabilities are not disadvantaged compared to others. These adjustments can address needs related to mental health, neurodiverse conditions, visual or hearing impairments, chronic illnesses, and mobility conditions.

Examples of reasonable adjustments which may be considered include:

- Flexible working hours
- Workspace adjustments (e.g., footrests, back support, adjustable desks)
- Remote/hybrid working options
- Additional training
- Providing a mentor
- Assistive technology

The Alan Turing Institute is committed to creating an inclusive, barrier-free workplace, recognising that providing reasonable adjustments is essential to supporting colleagues in fully participating in their roles.
A summary of the Institute's reasonable adjustment policy can be found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/reasonable-adjustments-policy),
with the full policy available for internal staff on [Mathison](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/sites/gc/Public%20Documents/Corporate%20Governance/Policies/People%20Policies/Reasonable%20Adjustment%20Policy%20Final.pdf).

The policy outlines the Institute’s legal obligations and promotes a proactive approach to considering requests, even if they fall outside the legal requirements of the Equality Act 2010.
For more details, contact information is available at the end of the document.

### Applying for Reasonable Adjustments

When starting your role at the Alan Turing Institute, you will be invited to fill out a health form (via Cezanne) to provide information related to reasonable adjustments. Your request will be reviewed by your line manager and HR. Depending on the nature of the request, it may be handled directly by facilities or lead to a discussion between you and HR to find the best solution. In some cases, you may be referred to occupational health for further advice.

If your circumstances change at any time during your employment, you can update your health information and request new or revised reasonable adjustments.
These updates will follow the same process to ensure continued support.

### Reasonable Adjustments for Prospective Applicants

Reasonable adjustments can also be requested for the application and interview process.
These may include adjustments to the interview format, additional time, or other necessary support.
If you require any adjustments, please contact [adjustments@turing.ac.uk](mailto:adjustments@turing.ac.uk).
This email is monitored by the HR team and will be treated confidentially.

## Support for Home Offices

All Turing staff are entitled to financial support for setting up a home workspace, including a desk and chair.
This support is available to all staff, but it is particularly useful for those who may not have access to an appropriate home working setup.
Claims for this can be made through the expenses system. More details are available for internal staff in [section 10 of the homeworking policy](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2218?SearchId=517007).

## Access to Work

For adjustments that may incur significant costs, the government’s Access to Work scheme can provide funding to support your role.
This may include funding for assistive technology, travel to work, or a support worker.

Applications for Access to Work must be made by the individual.
However, you can contact our external supervisor for guidance and assistance in applying.
Turing staff can make an appointment with the external supervisor [here](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/3052?SearchId=516953).
Applications can be made directly through the [Access to Work website](https://www.gov.uk/access-to-work/apply) or through their helpline (0800 121 7479).

## Accessibility at the Alan Turing Institute Offices and the British Library

Detailed information about the accessibility of the Alan Turing Institute offices and the British Library — including blue badge parking, step-free access, and hearing support systems—can be found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/contact-us/accessibility).
