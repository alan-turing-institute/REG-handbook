# Reasonable Adjustments Policy

'Reasonable adjustments' refer to changes to workplaces procedures or practices that are put in place to avoid a situation where a person with disabilities is disadvantaged compared to one without.

The Alan Turing Institute is committed to creating an inclusive, barrier-free workplace, recognising that providing reasonable adjustments is essential to supporting colleagues in fully participating in their roles.
A summary of the Institute's reasonable adjustment policy can be found [here](https://www.turing.ac.uk/reasonable-adjustments-policy),
with the full policy available for internal staff on [Mathison](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/sites/gc/Public%20Documents/Corporate%20Governance/Policies/People%20Policies/Reasonable%20Adjustment%20Policy%20Final.pdf).

The policy outlines the Instituteâ€™s legal obligations and emphasises a proactive approach to making reasonable adjustments, considering each request carefully even if it falls outside of the legal requirements as outlined in the Equality Act 2010.
It covers adjustments to workspaces, practices, roles, and other areas where barriers may exist.
Examples include adjustments for mental health, neurodiverse conditions, visual and hearing impairments, chronic illnesses, and mobility conditions.
