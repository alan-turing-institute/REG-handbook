# How Tos

This section contains a section of common technical practises within REG. For many of the topics in this section there may be many possible ways to achieve the same goal - which are debated at length elsewhere. The intention of this section is not to claim that any of the methods here are the "best" (however defined). Merely that they are good enough to allow the reader to focus on other, more interesting, unique or important, aspects of their project.
