# Drop-in Sessions

The group runs regular, informal, community-led sessions for students and researchers.
At the sessions they can ask the group about specific technical problems, or seek general technical advice.
The sessions offer a friendly, welcoming, non-judgemental environment to receive advice or assistance without concern about being judged on technical knowledge, expertise or understanding.

As our organisers and helpers know, many of us working with software in the research community have been trained in domains where computing has not traditionally been a key element.
There can be lots to learn in terms of new jargon and technical skills and we all have to start somewhere.

We can help with:

- General programming problems — including helping to identify and fix bugs.
- Cloud computing questions — including how to get started on Azure.
- Software sustainability — best practices for testing, managing and packaging your code.
- Reproducible research — ensuring software is developed to support long-term reproducibility, including techniques for packaging and archiving code.
- High Performance Computing (HPC) — support and advice on the HPC resources available at the Turing.

## Joining sessions

Our weekly sessions run for one hour from 13:30-14:30 every Tuesday and are hosted on [Zoom](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#video-call-links).
Everyone is welcome to drop-in at any time.
There is no need to register in advance.
