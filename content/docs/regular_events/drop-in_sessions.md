# Drop-in Sessions

Along with the _Data Wrangling team_, _Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)_, and the _Programme Management Unit (PMU)_, our group runs the [Turing Infrastructure Drop-in Sessions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins) which are regular, informal, community-led sessions for students and researchers. See more information on the sessions on the [`infrastructure-drop-ins`](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins) repo.

## Joining sessions

Our sessions are on Zoom (see link on the [Mathison page](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/3262) and sometimes hybrid.
We run several sessions a week (typically on Tuesdays and Wednesdays), so please see our [schedule](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins/wiki/Schedule) on the [repo's wiki](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins/wiki).
Also feel free to reach out to either Ryan Chan, Iain Stenson or Fede Nanni on Slack.

On the [People page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins/wiki/People), you can a short bio about the people running the sessions.

Feel free to message the [organisers listed on the repo README](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/infrastructure-drop-ins) ahead of time with your problem on Slack, or just come by!
There is no need to register in advance.
