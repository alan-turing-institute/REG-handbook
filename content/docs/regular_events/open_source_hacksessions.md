# Open Source Hacksessions

REG runs monthly sessions where we come together and contribute to upstream open-source repositories. The idea is to fence off time dedicated to contributing upstream and to do it together for joy and sociality. We hope to give back to many of the tools we use and learn about new packages by helping them out. Everyone is welcome to come and work on something they want to contribute to or join an effort someone else has already started.

The sessions take place from **2-5 pm every third Friday of the month** and are organised by REGâ€™s Open Source Service Area. If you have any questions, or want to join but don't have the calendar invite you can contact them by [email](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#regular-events) or on Slack (`#open-source-hacksessions`).
