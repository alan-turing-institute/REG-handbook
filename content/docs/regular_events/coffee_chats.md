# Randomised Coffee Chats

Approximately every 2 weeks, we partition REG into groups of 4 or 5 for informal chats.
The groups are randomly generated (see the code [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/randoffee/)) but generally try to ensure that everyone meets different people each week.

If you have not signed up already and would like to join (or conversely if you would like to opt out), please inform the [people in charge of the random coffees](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry).

{{% hint info %}}
Several years ago, during the periods of lockdown, we used to have daily coffee chats at 08:45 and 13:45.
These are very rarely used nowadays but the vestiges of these can still be seen in (for example) the daily notifications on Slack every morning.
