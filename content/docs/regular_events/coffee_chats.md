# Coffee Chats

The team has two optional, daily coffee chats at 08:45 and 13:45.
The chats usually happen in Gather but there is also a Zoom room in case Gather is unavailable.
Details for both rooms can be found [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry#video-call-links).
