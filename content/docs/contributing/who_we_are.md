# Who We Are

Our expertise:
- collaboration
- reproducibility
- (this is a bit more complex to describe but) either ability to integrate if a project management structure is in place or support the PI in defining one

## Who we are not

Postdocs:
- we don't have a research agenda (or a research area!)
- our perforamcne is not assessed on publications

Full-stack software developer:
- no guaranteed expertise in the specific tech / domain
