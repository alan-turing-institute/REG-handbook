# Discussions and Issues

Contributing does not only mean adding code or writing pages. Being involved in
reporting issues and discussing ideas are important and valuable aspects to
contributing. The handbook uses both issues and discussions on GitHub.

## Discussions

[The handbook
Dicussions](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/REG-handbook/discussions)
are the best place for informal talk about the handbook.

You should feel welcome to create a discussion on any relevant topic, without
the formality of an issue.

Good examples of discussions are

- Any questions
- Possible bugs (does anyone else have this problem?)
- Chapter suggestions
- Looking for collaborators
- Community support
- Any other on-topic talk

## Issues

[The issue
tracker](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/REG-handbook/issues) is best
used for development work. This is because issues integrate well with GitHub
development tools like projects, pull requests, assignments and so on.

Each issue should ideally represent a well-defined,
self-contained piece of work suitable to become a single pull request.

Good examples of issues are

- Bug reports with technical detail
- Developed chapter proposals
- Feature requests (such as new shortcodes)
- Specific ideas for changes

When opening an issue, pick a suitable template (if any) to make the process
easier.
