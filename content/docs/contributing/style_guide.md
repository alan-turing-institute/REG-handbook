## Semantic Line Breaks

It is strongly encouraged to use [Semantic Line Breaks](https://sembr.org/) when writing for the handbook.
This improves the readability of source files and make diffs clearer.
The Semantic Line Breaks [specification](https://sembr.org) explains the rules and reasoning.
The most important rules are

> - A semantic line break MUST occur after a sentence, as punctuated by a period (.), exclamation mark (!), or question mark (?).
> - A semantic line break SHOULD occur after an independent clause as punctuated by a comma (,), semicolon (;), colon (:), or em dash (â€”).
> - A semantic line break MAY occur after a dependent clause in order to clarify grammatical structure or satisfy line length constraints.
