# Contributing

This section contains a guide for contributing to the handbook. It is not a
comprehensive guide to Hugo or any of the other tools used. Instead it is aimed
to be a user-focused guide explaining how add to or edit the handbook without
dwelling on the details of the underlying technologies. For those interesting in
learning more, links will be liberally placed throughout for further reading.
