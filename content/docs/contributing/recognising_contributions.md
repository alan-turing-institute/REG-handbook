# Recognising Contributions

We aim to recognise all contributions to the handbook, not just those make through commits.
For that purpose we use [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) to help manage a record of who has contributed to the book and how.

Use the 'add' command in an issue or pull-request comment to ask @all-contributors to add a contributor

```
@all-contributors please add @<username> for <contributions>
```

See the [bot usage documenation](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/bot/usage) for full details and more examples.
A list of contribution types (and the related emoji) can be seen [here](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key).
