# Annual Appraisals

REG is a large team, with a relatively flat line management structure. Therefore we run a team-wide standardisation process where appraisals and progression award recommendations are reviewed to ensure consistency and fairness across the team.

Our goal is to work within the wider HR policy and guidance (see [HR Performance Review Guide](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/2319)) to prioritise what we think is most important for our team (fairness, transparency and a clear progression path) and provide clear guidance to achieve that.

## Principles

1. REG members who are operating at an equivalent level should receive equivalent pay.
1. We are a learning team and our default assumption is that people will generally be growing and developing in their role as they gain more experience.
1. Everyone who is performing and developing as expected for their role and their experience level within it should expect to progress through their pay band each year on top of the cost of living adjustment. This is very much in line with the guidance on salary increases from HR.
