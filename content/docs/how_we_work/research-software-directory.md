# Research Software Directory

## About 

The [Research Software Directory](https://research-software-directory.org/)(RSD) is a content management system created by the Netherlands eScience Center. 
It aims to promote the visibility, impact and reuse of research software and to encourage proper citation to ensure researchers and RSEs get credit for their work.

We (REG) have set up a page for [The Alan Turing Institute](https://research-software-directory.org/organisations/the-alan-turing-institute) on the RSD. 
We hope that this page will be a place where we can showcase the variety of software the REG team have developed. This could be beneficial for ourselves, collaborators (past and present), and potential future hires - to get a feel for the kind of things the team/institute work on, or even spark new collaborations.

As you can see, we've already added a few pieces of REG software to the Turing RSD. We're encouraging more people to do the same! 

## Getting Started

The RSD documentation can be found [here](https://research-software-directory.org/documentation/)

### Logging in to the RSD

You will need to use your [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) to log in to the RSD.

To request access, you should send an email from your Turing email account to `rsd@esciencecenter.nl` stating the following information:

- Your name.
- Your affiliation(s) - i.e. The Alan Turing Institute
- Your ORCID.
- Any example links illustrating the content you wish to add.

### How to join The Alan Turing Institute organisation on the RSD

Once you have logged in to the RSD, you will need to send [one of the RSD admins](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry) a message asking to be added to the Alan Turing Institute organisation.

## Adding software

### What software should be added

We would like the RSD to a place in which we can showcase REG software and so we suggest that only more polished software packages/libraries are added to it. 
This does not mean it needs to be perfect!

### How add software

Before adding a software library to the RSD, please:

- Check your project team are happy for you to do this.
- Gather ORCIDs for anyone who has worked on the software and would like to be added as a contributor.
- Gather any other relevant information (e.g. DOIs/links to papers)

Once you are set up, adding software to the RSD is **very easy and intuitive**.
Most of the information can be imported from the software's GitHub README so there is no additional maintenance required after setup.

Docs for how to add software can be found [here](https://research-software-directory.org/documentation/users/adding-software/).
