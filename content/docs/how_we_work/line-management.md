# Line Management

Line management in REG is a little different than in other parts of the Turing as you often will not be working directly with the people you are managing. This guide aims to explain how this relationship might work.

## How line management duties are assigned

At (current) senior level, people are expected to line manage 1-2 standards. This will probably change with the new lead role (see the [REG role matrix](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/blob/master/development/REG-Roles-Matrix.md#line-managementmentoring)). Currently, if seniors are willing to line manage more than 2 people, they should inform the recruitment lead (can be found in [service areas](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Service-areas)).

At standard level, opportunities for line management and project mentoring of junior members and interns are offered during the year. To assign such duties, we follow whenever possible time spent at standard level in REG.

At both levels, we try to avoid overlaps between projects and line management, at least during probation.

## First day

As a line manager you will have a 1-to-1 meeting with the person you will be managing on their first day. By this point they will have had various other inductions (eg. with HR, IT, their REG buddies). You might want to focus on the following points

- introduce what line management is at REG
    - part mentor, part escalation point, part pastoral support, part admin, can take different shapes depending on need
- ... and what it is isnâ€™t
    - task-setting, boss vibes, oversight
- point out that line management, like everything else in REG, is a collaboration
    - have a chat about what management styles have worked well for them.
- find out their background, why they decided to join the group
- discuss what their day-to-day might look like
    - 80% projects (either one or two projects)
    - 10% REG responsibilities (eg. service areas)
    - 10% personal development
- briefly talk about how people are allocated to projects
- check that they've taken a look at the [new starters checklist](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/onboarding/new_joiners/checklist/)
- leave time for questions

## First week

Later in the first week you might want to go through some of the more technical points:

- [Team reporting structure](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/Team-reporting-structure)
- Adding yourself to the [Turing GitHub organisation](https://turingcomplete.topdesk.net/tas/public/ssp/content/serviceflow?unid=3844fabf8b1c45ca9028758a350ff230)
- Emoji reacting to projects
    - Projects [looking for people](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2#column-2488036)
    - [Currently active](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Hut23/projects/2#column-1062281) projects
- Project allocations on [Forecast](https://forecastapp.com/974183/schedule/team)
- Personal time tracking on [Harvest](https://thealanturinginstitute.harvestapp.com/time/week) (noting that this is not compulsory)
- Probation formalities
