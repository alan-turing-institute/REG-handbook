# Open Access Journal Articles

The Turing has access to a block grant to cover open access charges for journal publications for UKRI funded projects if there are not already funds in the project-specific grant to cover them. If you have published an article, you may be able to cover the open access fees using this funding source. See [Open Access Publishing - Funding](https://mathison.turing.ac.uk/page/BlockGrant?SearchId=380294) on Mathison for further information.
