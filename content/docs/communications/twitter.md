# Twitter

The group has a Twitter account [@turinghut23](https://twitter.com/turinghut23).
The purpose of the account is to have an informal public-facing channel where we can communicate about projects we are working on and about life as a research engineer at the Turing.

## Access

If you want to tweet under the group account, ask [the account
controller](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-engineering-group/wiki/The-REGistry) for access.

This also gives you access to [Medium](https://medium.com/@turinghut23)

## What to Post

- Projects we work on (if public)
- Blog posts
- Talks that we organise
- Conferences and workshops
- Any public outputs - papers, published code etc.
