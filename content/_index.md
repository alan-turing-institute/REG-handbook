# Welcome to the Research Engineering Group Handbook

## What is this?

This Handbook is written by and for [The Alan Turing Institute's](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) Research Engineering Group (REG).
It is our attempt to describe both how we do work and how we aspire to.
It is inspired by other openly available handbooks, such has [GitLab's All Remote](https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/guide/), [Basecamp's books](https://37signals.com/books) and (closer to home) [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/remote-collab.html).

## Who is the audience?

Anyone!
Most commonly it is used by members of REG in their day-to-day work.
It also aims to be a helpful introduction to REG for anyone who might work with us, either as collaborators or - when the opportunity arises - as [future colleagues](https://www.turing.ac.uk/opportunities-turing/jobs).

It is open to all, in the hope others will find it useful too.

## Who are REG anyway?

For an introduction to REG and what we do see our page on the [Turing website](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-engineering).
